            <h3>Squat</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/squat.jpg" />
            <p>There are two styles of barbell back squat: the high bar and the low bar. As the name would suggest, the
                bar is held in a lower position in the low-bar style than in the high-bar squat style. Neither one
                should be considered better than the other, but you need to be aware that the technique differs slightly
                for each.</p>
            <h4>Form</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Take an even grip on the bar.
                </li>
                <li>Align the center of the bar with the center of your chest.
                </li>
                <li>Get under the bar and position the bar on your rear deltoids.
                </li>
                <li>Retract your shoulder blades and lift your chest.
                </li>
                <li>Stand straight up and unrack the bar.
                </li>
                <li>Step back to a position where you can perform the squat.
                </li>
                <li>Adjust your stance width and toe angle to confirm they are correct.
                </li>
                <li>Breathe in and brace your core.
                </li>
                <li>Squat down and stand back up without a pause.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Low Bar vs High Bar</h4>
            <p> In the low-bar squat, the barbell rests on the rear deltoids. In the high-bar squat the barbell rests on
                the traps. Here’s how the bar placements compare.</p>

            <h3>Bench</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/bench.jpg" />
            <ul>
                <li>Sit on the edge of the bench and lie on your back. Be careful not to hit your head on the bar.</li>
                <li>Align the center of your body and the bar. Bring your arms back and adjust the position of your body
                    so that the edges of the bench touch roughly the same parts of your back on both sides.</li>
                <li>Adjust your position front to back. When you’re bench pressing for the first time, a good starting
                    position is where the bar is directly above your eyes. But the appropriate position can change
                    depending on the design of the rack and hook. You may need to re-adjust your position after
                    practicing the movement.</li>
                <li>Grab the bar, bring your shoulder blades together, and raise your chest. It may be helpful to think
                    about pushing out your stomach.
                    Plant your feet on the floor, and make sure your entire soles are in contact with the floor.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Deadlift</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/deadlift.jpg" />
            <p>In the deadlift, you pull the bar from the floor with both your hands. When you reach a fully standing
                position, you put it back down again.</p>
            <ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <li>Stand behind the bar and adjust your stance.</li>
                <li>Pull your butt back and bend over.</li>
                <li> the bar just outside of your shins.</li>
                <li>Pull the bar close to your legs and raise your chest.</li>
                <li>Hold your breath and brace your core.</li>
                <li>From this position, pull the bar up.</li>
                <li>Push your butt back and lower the bar.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Form</h3>
            <p>
                Position yourself so that the bar is roughly over the middle of the foot. If you’re not sure, try
                placing the bar over the mid point of your shoelaces.</p>
            <p>Place your feet about shoulder-width apart. Try a little wider or narrower to find the stance that allows
                you to push most firmly into the floor as you deadlift. If you’re unsure how wide your stance should be,
                take a stance that you would use for a vertical jump. Start with that stance width and try a little
                wider or narrower to find the positioning where you feel the strongest.</p>

            <p>Adjust your toe angles. You can point your toes straight or outward a little. Try different toe angles
                and find the right combination with your stance width where you feel the strongest for your deadlifts.
            </p>

            <p>Generally, the knees should point in the same directions as your toes. Pointing your knees slightly
                outward may also work well. But when you drive your knees out, the thighs may rub against the arms. This
                can interfere with your movement. If this happens, try a slightly narrower stance or try a slightly
                wider grip to find a position where you can move freely where your thighs don’t rub on your arms when
                you deadlift.</p>
            <p>There are two different ways to grip the bar in the deadlift: the overhand grip with both hands facing in
                and the mixed grip with one hand facing in and the other hand facing out.The overhand grip is standard.
                The mixed grip allows you to hold onto the bar better.</p>
