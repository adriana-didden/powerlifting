                <h4>Choosing Your Timelines</h4>
                <h5>4 Phases of Training</h5>
                <h6>Prep</h6>
                <p>Here in this phase we focus on hypertrophy, meaning we we increase our work capacity, build lean muscle mass and refine our technique. This phase is furthest from the competition date and simply focusese on building a solid base for the rest of your training.
                </p>

                <h6>Strength</h6>
                <p>This of course is the phase where we focus on building our strength. This is where we spend the majority of our time before competitions, working in the 80%-90% range, but not going over the 90% range. 
                </p>

                <h6>Competition</h6>
                <p>In this phase we will develop the ability to express the strength that we developed in the previous phase. It requires high neurological demands and adaptations take place. Many lifters feel drainedd during this phase. It's typically the phase that is done the last few weeks leading into your competition. Accessory movements are decreased to compensate for working in the 90%+ range.
                </p>

                <h6>Recovery</h6>
                <p>Here we have the  post competition phase! This is where we lift at much lower percentages in order to allow the body to recover. 
                </p>

                <h4>Training Frequency</h4>
                <p>Many powerlifters train 3-5 days a week. Your age, recovery ability and overall skill level will determine how much you can handle. 
                </p>
                <p>Typically the more advanced a lifter is, and the stronger they are, the less high intensity training they can handle to recover from. Key is to not do TOO much</p>
                <p>Most beginners haven't developed enough to reach their genetic potential so this is lesso of a concern.
                </p>

                <h4>Main Movements(Strength Movements)</h4>
                <p>The main lifts consist of the back squat, bench press and deadlift(conventional or sumo). During the different phases you'll use different variations to manage muscle imbalances, or improve technique(all via your accessory movements). 
                </p>

                <h4>Accessory Movements</h4>
                <p>These exercises are important for your overall training via correcting muscle imbalances, minimize muscle imbalances and muscle growth. 
                </p>
                <h4>Sets, Reps, and Loading Schemes</h4>
                <p>Typically rhe higher the percentage(intensity) you're working in the fewer reps you'll do. Generally, strength development occurs in the 80-89% range. Hypertrophy occurs in the 65% - 80% range. Right before your competition you'll be training in percentages above 90 to acclimate yourself to heavier loads

                </p>
                <h4>Monitoring and Tracking Progress and Recovery</h4>
                <p>Track your percentages and number of reps you're able to do at each. We recommend keeping a journal for your workouts so you can see how far you've come. Note any mental and physical issues you're experiencing. This will all help you determine what's best for you as you continue in your journey. 
                </p>
                <h4>Modify and Repeat</h4>
                <p>Go over any new goals, possible injuries that need to be rehabed, past failures and build a program to address these issues. Using that information, rinse and repeat.
